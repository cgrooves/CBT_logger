        <h1>Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
            Bring to light the negative thoughts that you have been having.
            We will spell them out, identify key distortions and core beliefs
            driving them, and then work on the more accurate, positive thought
            that can counter it.
        </p>

        <h2>Negative Thought</h2>
        <p>
            What is a thought that has been weighing you down?
        </p>

        <h2>Core Belief(s)</h2>
        <p>
            Why are you inclined to believe that thought? What is it that you
            believe about yourself that makes it seem plausible or inevitable?
        </p>

        <h2>More Accurate, Positive Thought</h2>
        <p>
            What is the more accurate thought that is <strong>not</strong> aligned
            with that core belief or beliefs?
